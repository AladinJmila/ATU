STORY
************
Define Your Story Idea and Theme:

1 - Explore the topic
Think about what message or feeling you want to convey to your readers through your story.
Consider what aspects of this topic intrigue you the most. Is there a particular angle, 
perspective, or message you want to convey through your story?

-> The story should be relatable in someways to keep the reader connected.
-> Life is unfair in many ways but that doesn't mean we should give up, we should push through if 
we want to increase our chance of making a change
-> Relantless struggle that eventually pays off, giving readers feelings of hope 
-> Reader should at some point start believing that the protagonist has a chance of making it,
making their belief align with the end result will connect them more to the story
-> Only hard work by itself will increase the chances of making change, but mixing it with wittiness
will give the entire situation a boost
-> Dreams do come true eventually, not as an exact manifestation but as reality revised version
with less grandiosity but with a fair amount of positivitiy

2 - Brainstorming
Write down any ideas, scenes, or characters that come to mind. Don't worry about structure or coherence at this stage; 
the goal is to generate as many ideas as possible.

-> Someone born with some sort of disability that hinders their life since the get go, this gives them
awareness of their unique scenario enticing them to develop another set of skills to survive
-> Most of people look down on them and don't expect much fuling them with negativity
-> Very few people show them unexpected acts of kindness and believe them which feeds their
soul with enough life energy and hope giving them reasons to continue pushing through
-> They develop hypersensitivity allowing them to read hearts and connect with people in dire situations
-> They use this skill on someone and they help them despite their onwn seemingly helpless situation
creating a bond and opening the possibility to new chances. This person can turn out to be someone important
-> Maybe a funny rediculous disability that adds some positivity to the whole negative situation, making the 
reader sympathise but not feel too sad about it (John Oliver style)
-> Despite their hard circumstances, they choose to live a decent life. They hurt and conflict pain to others
under the pretext that life is unfair, if I suffer they should suffer.

3 - Identify the Core Conflict
Every compelling story revolves around a central conflict or problem that the characters must confront and resolve. 
Define what this conflict is for your story. It could be internal (a character's struggle with a decision or fear) or
external (a physical obstacle or antagonist).

-> Tough life, not fully equipped with tools to face it
-> Need to work extra hard to harness an alternative set of tools

4 - Theme Exploration
Themes are the underlying messages or insights that your story communicates. 
Think about what themes resonate with your chosen topic. Themes can be universal (love, betrayal, redemption) 
or more specific to your topic (innovation, resilience, transformation).

-> Resilience
-> Irony
-> Hope

CHARACTERS
************
Create Well-Rounded Characters:
Spend time creating well-rounded characters. Consider their backgrounds, motivations, 
and how they evolve throughout the story.

1 - Background and History
Think about your characters' backgrounds, including their upbringing, education, and past experiences. 
How have these shaped who they are today?

-> Reads some books, but he grew up around an environment that has a few smart people around. He could hear from 
a long distance so he often over heard smart people having conversations.
-> He produced natural black ink used in printing shops, he was often dirty with black because he lived by himself
-> He father showed him this when he was young and he loved doing it because it reminded him of the warmest heart

2 - Motivations and Goals

Understanding their motivations will help you portray their actions and decisions authentically throughout the story.

-> He wants to give back to the few people that helped through life, then become that kind of help to others in need

3 - Personality Traits
Define your characters' personalities in detail. Are they introverted or extroverted? Analytical or intuitive? 
How do they interact with others and handle challenges? Avoid one-dimensional characters by giving them a mix of 
strengths, weaknesses, and quirks that make them feel real.

************
Character Arcs:
1 - Growth and Change 
Consider how your characters will evolve over the course of the story. 
What challenges will they face, and how will these experiences impact their beliefs and actions? 
A well-crafted character arc allows readers to connect emotionally with your characters' journeys.

2 - Internal Conflicts
Explore internal conflicts within your characters, such as moral dilemmas, self-doubt, 
or conflicting desires. These inner struggles add depth and complexity, making your characters more relatable and engaging.

************
Visualize and Describe:

1 - Physical Descriptions
Provide enough physical details to help readers visualize your characters. 
Focus on distinctive features or mannerisms that set them apart. However, avoid overwhelming 
readers with excessive detail; instead, integrate descriptions naturally into the narrative.

2 - Emotional Depth
Show your characters' emotions through their actions, dialogue, and internal thoughts. 
Allow readers to empathize with their joys, fears, frustrations, and hopes. Emotional 
authenticity enhances the connection between readers and characters.

************
Techniques for Character Development:

Answer detailed questions about your characters' beliefs, fears, relationships, and 
past experiences to flesh out their personalities.

PLOT
************
Outline Your Plot:
Outline the main events and plot points of your story. This doesn't have to be extremely 
detailed initially, but it should give you a roadmap to follow as you write. 
Pay attention to the beginning, middle, and end of your story to ensure a satisfying narrative arc.

************
Identify Key Elements:

1 - Introduction (Exposition)
Introduce your protagonist and the primary setting. Set the stage by establishing the normalcy of 
their world before the central conflict arises. This section should hook the reader and provide 
essential background information.

2 - Conflict (Rising Action)
Introduce the central conflict or problem that drives the story forward. 
This could be an external challenge (e.g., a technological dilemma, a moral decision) or an internal 
struggle (e.g., self-doubt, conflicting desires).

3 - Complications and Rising Tension
Develop the plot by introducing obstacles and complications that hinder your protagonist's progress 
toward resolving the conflict. Each obstacle should increase the stakes and tension, pushing the story towards its climax.

4 - Climax
The climax is the turning point of the story, where the conflict reaches its peak. It's the moment of 
greatest tension and decision-making for your protagonist. This could involve a pivotal confrontation, a significant 
realization, or a critical choice.

5 - Resolution (Falling Action and Conclusion)
After the climax, resolve the conflict and tie up loose ends. Show how the protagonist deals with 
the aftermath of their decisions and actions. Provide closure for the reader while leaving room for 
reflection on the story's themes and lessons.

************
Crafting a Narrative Arc:

1 - Beginning, Middle, and End
Ensure your plot has a clear beginning (introduction of characters and setting), 
middle (development of conflict and rising action), and end (climax, resolution, and conclusion). 
This structure helps maintain momentum and keeps readers engaged.

2 - Character Development Through Plot
Use the plot to drive your characters' growth and change. Each stage of the story should challenge them 
in new ways, forcing them to confront their beliefs, values, and motivations.

************
Mapping Out Your Outline:

1 - Storyboard or Timeline
Visualize your plot using a storyboard or timeline. Outline key scenes, plot points, and character interactions. 
This visual representation can help you identify gaps, pacing issues, or opportunities for dramatic tension.

2 - Outline Format
Create a detailed outline that includes bullet points or brief descriptions of each plot point and scene. 
This roadmap will guide your writing process and prevent you from getting lost or veering off track.

SCENE
************
Set the Scene:
Describe the time and place where your story unfolds in a way that immerses the reader. 
Think about how the setting influences the characters and the events of the story.

************
Establishing Time and Place:

1 - Time Period
Determine the time period in which your story takes place. Is it set in the present day, 
the past, or the future? Pay attention to historical context or technological advancements 
that may influence the setting.

2 - Physical Setting
Describe the physical environment where your story unfolds. Consider the architecture, 
landscapes, weather, and sensory details (sounds, smells, textures) that create a vivid impression in the reader's mind.

************
Creating Atmosphere:

1 - Mood and Tone
Establish the mood and tone of your story through the setting. Is it mysterious, serene, tense, or nostalgic? 
Use descriptive language and sensory imagery to evoke emotions and set the atmosphere.

2 - Symbolism and Imagery
Use symbolic elements or recurring motifs in the setting to enhance thematic depth. 
For example, in a story about technology and ethics, you might use contrasting images of sleek, modern architecture versus natural 
landscapes to symbolize the clash between innovation and ethics.

************
Integration with Plot and Characters:

1 - Influence on Characters
Show how the setting impacts your characters' behaviors, beliefs, and interactions. 
A bustling city might evoke a sense of urgency and ambition in your protagonist, while a quiet countryside 
retreat could inspire introspection or relaxation.

2 - Plot Development
Use the setting to advance the plot and create narrative tension. For instance, a stormy night 
might heighten suspense during a crucial scene, or a tranquil garden could serve as a backdrop for 
a moment of reflection or revelation.

************
Techniques for Setting Development:

1 - Show, Don’t Tell
Sensory Details: Instead of stating facts about the setting, engage readers' senses to create a more 
immersive experience. Describe how the air feels against the skin (is it humid, crisp?), the scent of nearby 
flowers or food stalls, the sounds of traffic or birdsong, and the play of light and shadow.

Specific Imagery: Use specific details to paint a clear picture in the reader's mind. For example, instead of saying 
"it was a busy street," describe how "pedestrians hurried past, their footsteps echoing against the tall glass facades of skyscrapers."

Action and Interaction: Show how characters interact with the setting to reveal its nuances. For instance, describe how a character
pauses to admire the city skyline from a rooftop, or how they navigate through a crowded marketplace, brushing past vendors and shoppers.

2 - Use of Language
Figurative Language: Employ metaphors and similes to create vivid associations with the setting. For example, describe 
a bustling city street as "a river of humanity flowing between towering cliffs of steel and glass," evoking both movement and the urban landscape.

Symbolism: Use symbolic language to convey deeper meanings related to the setting. For instance, a rundown neighborhood 
could symbolize neglect and social inequality, while a pristine park might symbolize peace and natural harmony.

Tone and Atmosphere: Adjust your language to match the tone and atmosphere you want to convey. Use sharp, staccato sentences 
to create tension in a suspenseful scene, or lyrical, flowing prose to evoke a sense of tranquility in a pastoral setting.

3 - Consistency and Authenticity
Detail Consistency: Ensure details about the setting remain consistent throughout your story. 
If you describe a character's apartment as minimalist and modern in one scene, it shouldn't suddenly become 
cluttered and old-fashioned later without a clear reason for the change.

Cultural and Contextual Authenticity: Research or draw from personal experience to accurately depict cultural elements, 
historical periods, or technological advancements relevant to your setting. This authenticity helps readers suspend
disbelief and immerse themselves in the world you've created.

Character Interaction: Use the setting as a backdrop for character development and interaction. 
Show how characters respond to their environment, revealing their attitudes, beliefs, and emotions 
through their interactions with the setting.
